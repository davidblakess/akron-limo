# README for a Limo Rental Site - Akron

## Is renting a limousine worth it?

Let's face it, we're never owning a limousine. A good car? Sure.
But a limousine? That is almost impossible.

You can probably count in your one hand the number of times you've
seen a limousine driving down the road. They are that rare. And 
almost every time you see one, they are being used for a big event
or a ceremony that is prestigious.

Well, you sometimes can see them being used in prom but that doesn't
negate the fact that they are in fact prestigious cars reserved for
the best occasion. After all, everyone wants to have a good entrance.

## Why did limousine become popular for big events?

Nobody can really give an accurate answer of that question. The fact
is, it sort of just happened. Limousines are popular in the early 1950s
where you can run into one almost everyday. That is how popular they are.

However, at the turn of the century, compact cars became the norm. They
are more efficient and easily maneuverable in tight spaces. The roads
back then were small and small cars offer convenience in terms of
driving which is why they became so popular.

Due to the popularity of small compact vehicles, limousines became rare.
In fact, only the wealthiest can now afford them, thanks to their high
upkeep and maintenance cost. They are roomier inside which the elites
prefer. Only a decade after their popularity, limousines became like a
collector's item for the rich.

## Limousine today

Fast forward to today's world, limousines have become such an artifact
of class and prestige. Only the rich can afford one. Only the wealthiest
regularly ride in one.

Luckily for you, you can rent a limousine today for a fair price. Sure,
the rental cost is going to be more expensive than renting an average
sedan but the experience is truly unique and special. For one night,
you can now ride inside a limousine and experience prestige.
